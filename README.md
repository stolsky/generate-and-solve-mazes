## Abstract
Visualization of the generation and solution of mazes with various algorithms.

## NaPAC - Not another Pathfinding Algorithm Comparison

* [ ] Test with different kinds of mazes (perfect, with circles, only with obstacles)
* [ ] tests different heuristics (taxicab, euclidean distance) for A* or other algorithms
* [ ] set your own seed to analyze the same maze with different algorithms, start and goal positions, etc.
* [ ] create your own maze or playground
  * width, height
  * different grids consisting of rectangle, triangle or hexagonal cells
* [ ] set the start and goal position yourself
* [ ] by default select different start and goal positions to not favour a specific algorithm
* [ ] better control over the simulation
  * play, pause the simulation
  * change the simulation speed
  * skip generation or solving to get faster to the results
  * set auto pause after generation and/or solution to view the result
* [ ] flood the maze/playground to visualize certain qualities
