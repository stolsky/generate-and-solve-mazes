## Abstract
Visualization of the generation and solution of mazes with various algorithms.

## NaPAC - Not another Pathfinding Algorithm Comparison
<!-- Why another comparison? 
List reasons
-->

### Create your own maze
* [ ] set dimensions (width, height)
* [ ] set different grids by selecting rectangle, triangle or hexagonal cells
* [ ] set type of mazes
  * perfect, with circles
  * only with sparse/moderate/dense obstacles
* [ ] set the start and goal position yourself
* [ ] force the random path (solution) to be short, medium or long
* [ ] set your own seed
  * to analyze the same maze with different algorithms, start and goal positions, etc.
* [ ] select own maze generator
* [ ] dig your maze by yourself (in one/some/every iteration)
* [ ] choose path finding algorithms
* [ ] tests different heuristics (taxicab, euclidean distance) for A* or other algorithms
* [ ] set flood option to flood the maze/playground after generation to visualize certain qualities

### Automation-galore
* [ ] provide ready to go setup
* [ ] select different start and goal positions in every iteration to not favour a specific algorithm

### Better control over the simulation
* [ ] play and pause the simulation any time
* [ ] change the simulation speed
* [ ] skip generation or solving to get faster to the results
* [ ] set auto pause after generation and/or solution to view the result
